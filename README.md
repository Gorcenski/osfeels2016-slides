This talk was given on July 23, 2016 at Open Source & Feelings in Seattle, WA.

I don't feel as though the slides stand alone. However, a video of the talk will be posted shortly. In addition, I have a pending publication coming up which serves as a companion to this talk. This repo will be updated when those become available.
